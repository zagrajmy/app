### Organisms

Stealing the name from Atomic Design Methodology, our Organisms are **domainâ€‘specific**, but **independent** UI **compositions**.

#### ðŸŽ² **Domain-specific**

These components contain knowledge about our product.
They're not useful as reusable in other apps.

#### ðŸ—½ **Independent**

They take props, and return JSX elements.
Any internal state they have is UI state.

- Prefer HTML-style prop names over `Pick`ed names derived from
  database or APIs.

#### ðŸ§± **Composition**

Organisms are composition of smaller reusable components.

- Minimize styling on this level.
- Pass props to reusable design-only components.
